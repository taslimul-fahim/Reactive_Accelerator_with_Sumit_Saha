# Event Propagation in React

## Event Delegation in JavasCript:
- Event delegation in JavaScript means putting a single "event listener" on a parent element to manage events for all its child elements, making the code more efficient and flexible.
- Code explained in `script.js`.
- Event delegation in JavaScript keeps working for new elements added later, whether they come dynamically or from APIs, maintaining the same event handling set up initially defined.
